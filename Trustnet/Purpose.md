- It will be the natural place that staff look to find and broadcast **news and updates, exchange ideas and communicate** with each other.

- The intranet will help us to **develop collaborative communities** based around activities and interests, as well as division, department or team.

- News will be presented in a timely manner according to user interests and strategic importance.

- Users will not be presented with duplicate or irrelevant content.

- Content will not open as standalone documents unless absolutely necessary.

- Navigation will be as flat and simple as possible.
