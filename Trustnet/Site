## All pages / content 

### Supported content 

Video: we will be able to use video on the new site – but it will be hosted on our (private) YouTube channel. 

TBC - AV may have access so they can upload their own content

Images 2mb is the max size

### Default page elements

(favicon)
page title - “[Page Title] | Trustnet”

Sidebar 
Closing sidebar via click anywhere in the browser

CSS animated transitions aren't supported by IE9, however the nav bar is still accessible and functional without the animation so I believe this is an acceptable fallback.

### Comments

‘Submit’ buttons on forms inactive until something has been entered 

Comment boxes should have one style everywhere

# Working at Wellcome 

content has to be from a department not a division 

Links to documents (sharepoint hosted) on information tables won’t be available off the network until 2FA is set up

### Forms

> As a user, I want to find forms grouped with relevant contextual content rather than other forms, so that I can find them easily find them at the relevant moment.

> As a user, when I submit a web form, I want to be emailed a copy of the information I sent, so that I can trust it has been submitted and so that I can keep records.

> As a user I want forms to have show who they apply to and what department they came from, in line with other W@W content, so that it is clear who they are for. [INT-343]

Admin accounts can add people to receive the form via the form > webform tab > emails


### Policies

> As a user, I want all-staff policies to appear on the intranet, so that they are easy to find and read.

> As a Web Editor, I want to able to review and publish content in the policy section so that I can maintain editorial and UX standards.


### Courses 

> As a user, I want training course info to include a breakdown of the session and skills they could learn, so they can see if the course is right for them.


### Jobs 

When adding a job that goes to the external jobs listing site, the form currently asks for the ID of the job on the system - Tracey and Sonia aren't familiar with these (and don't use them for anything else) and asked if we could just link to the full URL instead? This would also be good for them if the system changed or if they were posting an external secondment listed elsewhere.

# Org charts / Organisation 

https://trustnet.wellcome.ac.uk/organisation
(It did open org charts view, but users prefered the drop down index view. 20/8/2015

> As HR I want to be able to control some elements of the people directory via SelectHR, to avoid duplication and ensure changes are made instantly.

> As a user  I want to see a simple visual representation of the structure of the Trust, so that I can see how roles and departments fit together.

zoom is limited
org charts are prevented from being pushed off the screen

HR updates org charts at 5am syncs imports Select HR data. Any users who have left will be disabled. 

HR have the option to show and hide someone 

In the HR data there are Departments and Divisions, a department eg. People and Facilities is a division


I want the staff directory and the org chats to be related so that I can see where people fit in

Override / Administer Org chart settings / exceptions - this page HR can access, and it is up to them to own and manage. Extra org chart - you can add someone to an extra org chart goup but they have to have someone as their line manager to appear there. Extra manager - for someone who is in two teams 

**Secondments**

At launch: 
Secondments don’t show in org charts 
On a profile - the way to indicate that you are on a secondment is in the status field. 

> As a UX designer, I want to include org charts as web content (not standalone), so that users have a seamless browsing experience.

### Shared PAs 


###Accents in Names 

[Here] is a doc with a conversation with HR about this (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkTqMLEZWzDMPYEBWtjR4Ey-ee_4XwiH8OeP2M0bZ_4/edit)

### Quirks 

It won’t show people who are on maternity cover eg. James Mudd. ACF says this is a problem with HR’s data. 

Claire has decided to not show interns in the org charts

Grads Graudates - we have asked HR if they can include them in the org chart in the place they are doing their placement - this is yet to be confirmed

#Groups

You can be a follower of department group a non contributing member of protected groups a member of protected groups a member of department groups

I'd like people from appropriate departments to be added to a group on creation - all you have to do is to save a departmental group and the members will be added
(groups landing page)

a description element serves as department info, can include who to contact for which services news relating to that group an event calendar a forum, where users can ask questions and hold discussions a list of that group’s members (and Group Owners), linking to their profiles links to related content, e.g. org chart (if department group only), related policies or forms a link to that group’s SharePoint, if relevant

Design:

hover over groups = blue border Groups I’m following

As a user I'd like to be able to follow or unfollow a group so that I can see news and events posted to it on my home page. - A user should be able to follow any group that they aren’t a member of - protected or unprotected (I think 27/6/2015).
Given I am a member of comms department group I cannot follow the group. Given I am looking at an unprotected group page, I can

Once a group has been requested, the Web Team will be responsible for checking that it is not a duplicate, and that it fits with the Principles before setting up the group within five working days of the request.

As a Group Member, I want to be able to easily add a link in a news story or event to a SharePoint document or site, so that people reading the content can follow it

As a UX designer, I want functional groups containing news, events and a collaborative element, so that I can structure the content in this way. AD accounts are set to automatically follow directors office, learning and development, staff forum and wellies
Group Owners

anyone can request a group, for any reason (project team, topic related, social), but under strict “use it or lose it” conditions.

Each group will need at least one Group Owner (max. three for support/cover). We suggest that for the department groups, this role is taken up by the current Content Editor. Where there isn’t one, an Owner will need to be found.

Group Owners will need to be determined for new groups as they are requested, with the assumption that the requestor will take on this role, at the discretion of the Web Editor.

(which should be very simple). The name of the Group Owner(s) will be clear on the group page

> As a group owner

> I'd like to be able to request that news is pushed to the home pages of all users, so that all staff can see it.
> Create groups 'Edit' view

They will also administer membership

> As a departmental group owner

> I need to be able to add the department org chart so that people can access it easily. [INT-341]

> I want to be able to add a link to a group's sharepoint on the group landing page so that it can easily be found.

### A group page

Can add other groups as related content in a group

character limit on short descriptions for groups is 500


### All group types

The group owners will decide if they can be contributing or non-contributing members. Contributing members will be able to contribute news and events to the group.

There is a maximum of 3 (three) group owners allowed for a group and there must be one.

Non-contributing members and followers will have the same access as nonmembers, but will be able to see news and events in their homepage feed.

Nonmembers can still read content within a group by visiting the page, ‘like’ content, add comments to news and contribute to discussions.

As web editor, I would like new users to automatically be followers of a specified set of groups, so that they have useful information when they first use the intranet.

### Department groups (and protected groups)

Users will have default membership of their department groups, and will also be able to follow other department groups (as you cannot join another department), or request membership of any other group.

Non department groups

### Groups index

As a manager, I want staff to be able to easily find key contacts in my department/team so that they know who to speak to to access our services

As a user I want to see a searchable index of groups showing title and description so that I know what groups there are.

Groups will be searchable, and will also have an index page - a searchable and sortable list of groups with summary paragraphs stating their purpose. These summaries will also be produced by the Group Owners. Users will also be able to request new groups from this page.

I want to be able to join unprotected groups, so that I can quickly see what's important to me. HOMEPAGE

change way in which typekit fonts are called to prevent it slowing down the site if it's unavailable

# Profiles 

When a new user joins, a profile should be created automatically and in place before their start date. New users should then be encouraged to complete their profiles as quickly as possible, ideally as part of their IT induction on their first day.

Profiles will be linked to from groups and org charts.

Extension / Phone numbers are called in from AD data, which can (only) be updated by the IT service desk. When someone logs in for the first time, it will pull this data from AD. So if someone doesn’t have an extension number either they haven’t logged in, or IT service desk can be told that it is missing.

As a staff member, I want to be able to share with people what I'm responsible for and what my skill set is, so that they know what to come to me for.

As a user, I want to be able to easily remind people to update their user profiles if I see that they are out of date, so that they know.

As a user I want all staff to have profile pages that are clearly laid out so that I can find information about them.

As a user, I want to be able to update some of my own information in the people directory, so that I can make sure it's correct

As a user, I want to see better information about where in the building someone sits, so that I can find them.

As a user, I would like the option of including a link to my professional twitter or linkedin, so that I can connect with other staff members.

As a user, I want staff profiles to have short job descriptions so that I know what someone is responsible for and what they are currently working on.

As web editor, I would like new users to automatically be followers of a specified set of groups, so that they have useful information when they first use the intranet.
To be current, users need to be able to complete and update their own profiles, with some fixed information being automatically pulled from a single source of data to maintain accuracy and consistency, avoiding overlap and ensuring that HR/IT retain control of key data.

### Create staff profile 'edit' view

> As a user I'd like to see a skills listing page so that I can understand who can help me with a particular thing.

(Not on JIRA) As a Web Project Coordinator I want a form to sign up Drupal Accounts to that non trust staff can access Trustnet

PA’s on profiles - 
Editing a profile 

“Add to team (for contractor's)” field - allows them to be added manually to a departmental group but doesn't add them to an org chart or show that they they are part of that team on their profile.
