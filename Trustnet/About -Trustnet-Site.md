## Users and Acess


> As web editor, I'd like Trust employees, Service Partners, Contractors and Tenants to have 'normal' access to the intranet so that we can share with them.


### All Drupal Accounts

Automated Email Currently says Subject: An administrator created an account for you at Trustnet Body: First name Second name, A site administrator at Trustnet has created an account for you. You may now log in by clicking this link or copying and pasting it to your browser:https://trustnet.wellcome.ac.uk/user/reset/1389/1439988072/za9yh9-kvIi-sv5R2_k_V7zGAl21d7Xvm_NTGbZWOss This link can only be used once to log in and will lead you to a page where you can set your password. After setting your password, you will be able to log in at https://trustnet.wellcome.ac.uk/user in the future using: username: First Name Second Name Test password: Your password – Trustnet team

### All Service partners

When creating accounts I need to add them to facilities department group so that Claire can add them to the department group Tenants or Service partners with an AD account and an HR account (not a drupal account) eg.

eg. someone employed by the trust but part of a tenant or service partner eg. some of AMR team. They should log in with their AD account because any drupal account made will be a duplicate.

Tenants or Service partners with an AD account (no HR account) (not a drupal account)

Are only ‘allowed’ a Trustnet account if their employer have TOU in place but they would be able to log on with their AD account.

WPC can make an account for them, (unless they have logged on with their AD information - and a profile will have been made automatically.) the mandatory information can be included in their profile.

When creating a password - it is irrelevant, only the AD account will work for their login.

When creating an account - Use their AD username.

They will be able to access sharepoint.

### Drupal Accounts (no AD account) - Tenants and Service providers

Won’t be in org charts

Are added manually by WPC when requested by their account contact and having a signed Terms of Use document in place

Contractors with AD accounts (not in HR database but in AD database) (not a Drupal Account)

Any contractor with an AD account can log in - at which point they will have a Trustnet profile.

They will not appear in org chats

Their data is pulled in from IT’s AD data which at the moment doesn’t have what department they work in.

They can be manually added to a department group but only after someone with edit access has added them by the "add to team (for contractor's)" field

### Anomalies / troubleshooting

James Mudd - has a non AD email address in HR. So he should log in with his AD account details which will be James.Mudd@amr-review.org and normal password

To find an AD account’s username you can right click their email address in outlook (to: field) > properties > alias.

If a user has two accounts (- it seems like they get blocked

Their AD account needs to be in a verified group Windows 7 users group is verified Generic Accounts (I think isn’t verified)

### Leavers / old accounts

Enabled / disabled: is purely a drupal thing. If someone isn’t in the HR extract any more but they were, their account will be disabled.

if someone is in HR and has logged on with their AD account they are enabled. If someone has been marked as left in HR they are disabled: their profile will be hidden but their content will stay.

Account blocked (what happens when someone leaves) will mean that they aren't visible from anywhere.

Disabled accounts eg. https://trustnet.wellcome.ac.uk/user/hurleyo are still visible if linked to but they do not appear in org charts or groups.

HR: It is the responsibility of the employee to notify HR when they change their name. Change of name has implications on Payroll, Pensions, and Healthcare amongst other things. When we hear of a change of name, SelectHR is updated and payroll, AXA, security, and the pension providers are notified. The employee is advised that they need to contact IT to get their logonid/email address changed. There is no requirement for the employee to provide documentary evidence. In terms of synchronising changes to logonid with IT so that access to SelectHR is unaffected, the employee is told to notify HR again once their logonid has been changed by IT, and then the corresponding change is made to their SelectHR account.

I don’t believe admin were aware of this particular change. They tell me that quite often the employee realises that they need to notify payroll, and then Nick Bowden notifies HR. There have been occasions where employees have been unable to take up their Healthcare because their details didn’t match those held by AXA and then they have notified us of changes.

Going forward we are debating making name change available via self-service on the basis that the easier it is to do the more likely the employee is to do it, but there are significant risks in doing this, as employees (in other organisations, of course!)often find it amusing to enter spurious personal details.

HR notify payrol, securitty, axa insurance. They tell the individual that they have to update IT.

Erland is contracted to update select HR to 2.1 - he will be in touch with debbie about dates for testing how it works with the extract on stage. 6 - 10 weeks ahead of launch of trustnet (so november december)

Tracey, Sonia Erland and Glenn have access to the HR reported issues sheet Tracey and Sonia have the HR generic email address, so they get the requests from Trustnet org charts. They are able to update email addresses.

New starters will usually be added before they arrive (but with no email address) HR then tell IT,who make them an email address and then HR update their records. So new starters will probably come in through the extract without email addresses, then when they log in AD will link.

Contractors like Noel Quinn - HR donsn’t want their names in HR, they want to use position Null.

Gary Campbell is the IT HR account manager

Erland has a document started with ACF (missing ACFs part) about the extract.

Select HR is hosted by a third party, and connects through a vpn.

When an AD account changes - Eg. AD username was SherrarK and changed to SherratK. Updating the account from AD didn’t allow her to log in, changing her username on Trustnet didn’t allow her to log in, I had to change her account in order for her to log in.

### Accents in names 

If HR agree to include accents they will appear on peoples names - eg. Barbara Rodriguez Munoz and their AD account still links (is it linked by email address only?) 
Search won't find them if people search without the accents - but they can include their name without accents in their profile description. 

### Incorrect Password 
Locks you out for 15-20 minutes 


### Admin
- Update user from AD (available to WPC) currently updates Name and Job title only. 
-

## All pages / content 

### Supported content 

Video: we will be able to use video on the new site – but it will be hosted on our (private) YouTube channel. 

TBC - AV may have access so they can upload their own content

Images 2mb is the max size

### Default page elements

(favicon)
page title - “[Page Title] | Trustnet”

Sidebar 
Closing sidebar via click anywhere in the browser

CSS animated transitions aren't supported by IE9, however the nav bar is still accessible and functional without the animation so I believe this is an acceptable fallback.

# Working at Wellcome 

content has to be from a department not a division 

Links to documents (sharepoint hosted) on information tables won’t be available off the network until 2FA is set up

### Courses 

> As a user, I want training course info to include a breakdown of the session and skills they could learn, so they can see if the course is right for them.


### Jobs 

When adding a job that goes to the external jobs listing site, the form currently asks for the ID of the job on the system - Tracey and Sonia aren't familiar with these (and don't use them for anything else) and asked if we could just link to the full URL instead? This would also be good for them if the system changed or if they were posting an external secondment listed elsewhere.

# Org charts / Organisation 

https://trustnet.wellcome.ac.uk/organisation
(It did open org charts view, but users prefered the drop down index view. 20/8/2015

> As HR I want to be able to control some elements of the people directory via SelectHR, to avoid duplication and ensure changes are made instantly.

> As a user  I want to see a simple visual representation of the structure of the Trust, so that I can see how roles and departments fit together.

zoom is limited
org charts are prevented from being pushed off the screen

HR updates org charts at 5am syncs imports Select HR data. Any users who have left will be disabled. 

HR have the option to show and hide someone 

In the HR data there are Departments and Divisions, a department eg. People and Facilities is a division


I want the staff directory and the org chats to be related so that I can see where people fit in

Override / Administer Org chart settings / exceptions - this page HR can access, and it is up to them to own and manage. Extra org chart - you can add someone to an extra org chart goup but they have to have someone as their line manager to appear there. Extra manager - for someone who is in two teams 

**Secondments**

At launch: 
Secondments don’t show in org charts 
On a profile - the way to indicate that you are on a secondment is in the status field. 

> As a UX designer, I want to include org charts as web content (not standalone), so that users have a seamless browsing experience.

### Shared PAs 


###Accents in Names 

[Here] is a doc with a conversation with HR about this (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkTqMLEZWzDMPYEBWtjR4Ey-ee_4XwiH8OeP2M0bZ_4/edit)

### Quirks 

It won’t show people who are on maternity cover eg. James Mudd. ACF says this is a problem with HR’s data. 

Claire has decided to not show interns in the org charts

Grads Graudates - we have asked HR if they can include them in the org chart in the place they are doing their placement - this is yet to be confirmed 

***

#Groups

You can be a follower of department group a non contributing member of protected groups a member of protected groups a member of department groups

I'd like people from appropriate departments to be added to a group on creation - all you have to do is to save a departmental group and the members will be added
(groups landing page)

a description element serves as department info, can include who to contact for which services news relating to that group an event calendar a forum, where users can ask questions and hold discussions a list of that group’s members (and Group Owners), linking to their profiles links to related content, e.g. org chart (if department group only), related policies or forms a link to that group’s SharePoint, if relevant

Design:

hover over groups = blue border Groups I’m following

As a user I'd like to be able to follow or unfollow a group so that I can see news and events posted to it on my home page. - A user should be able to follow any group that they aren’t a member of - protected or unprotected (I think 27/6/2015).
Given I am a member of comms department group I cannot follow the group. Given I am looking at an unprotected group page, I can

Once a group has been requested, the Web Team will be responsible for checking that it is not a duplicate, and that it fits with the Principles before setting up the group within five working days of the request.

As a Group Member, I want to be able to easily add a link in a news story or event to a SharePoint document or site, so that people reading the content can follow it

As a UX designer, I want functional groups containing news, events and a collaborative element, so that I can structure the content in this way. AD accounts are set to automatically follow directors office, learning and development, staff forum and wellies
Group Owners

anyone can request a group, for any reason (project team, topic related, social), but under strict “use it or lose it” conditions.

Each group will need at least one Group Owner (max. three for support/cover). We suggest that for the department groups, this role is taken up by the current Content Editor. Where there isn’t one, an Owner will need to be found.

Group Owners will need to be determined for new groups as they are requested, with the assumption that the requestor will take on this role, at the discretion of the Web Editor.

(which should be very simple). The name of the Group Owner(s) will be clear on the group page

> As a group owner

> I'd like to be able to request that news is pushed to the home pages of all users, so that all staff can see it.
> Create groups 'Edit' view

They will also administer membership

> As a departmental group owner

> I need to be able to add the department org chart so that people can access it easily. [INT-341]

> I want to be able to add a link to a group's sharepoint on the group landing page so that it can easily be found.

### A group page

Can add other groups as related content in a group

character limit on short descriptions for groups is 500


### All group types

The group owners will decide if they can be contributing or non-contributing members. Contributing members will be able to contribute news and events to the group.

There is a maximum of 3 (three) group owners allowed for a group and there must be one.

Non-contributing members and followers will have the same access as nonmembers, but will be able to see news and events in their homepage feed.

Nonmembers can still read content within a group by visiting the page, ‘like’ content, add comments to news and contribute to discussions.

As web editor, I would like new users to automatically be followers of a specified set of groups, so that they have useful information when they first use the intranet.

### Department groups (and protected groups)

Users will have default membership of their department groups, and will also be able to follow other department groups (as you cannot join another department), or request membership of any other group.

Non department groups

### Groups index

As a manager, I want staff to be able to easily find key contacts in my department/team so that they know who to speak to to access our services

As a user I want to see a searchable index of groups showing title and description so that I know what groups there are.

Groups will be searchable, and will also have an index page - a searchable and sortable list of groups with summary paragraphs stating their purpose. These summaries will also be produced by the Group Owners. Users will also be able to request new groups from this page.

I want to be able to join unprotected groups, so that I can quickly see what's important to me. HOMEPAGE

change way in which typekit fonts are called to prevent it slowing down the site if it's unavailable

***

# Profiles 

When a new user joins, a profile should be created automatically and in place before their start date. New users should then be encouraged to complete their profiles as quickly as possible, ideally as part of their IT induction on their first day.

Profiles will be linked to from groups and org charts.

Extension / Phone numbers are called in from AD data, which can (only) be updated by the IT service desk. When someone logs in for the first time, it will pull this data from AD. So if someone doesn’t have an extension number either they haven’t logged in, or IT service desk can be told that it is missing.

As a staff member, I want to be able to share with people what I'm responsible for and what my skill set is, so that they know what to come to me for.

As a user, I want to be able to easily remind people to update their user profiles if I see that they are out of date, so that they know.

As a user I want all staff to have profile pages that are clearly laid out so that I can find information about them.

As a user, I want to be able to update some of my own information in the people directory, so that I can make sure it's correct

As a user, I want to see better information about where in the building someone sits, so that I can find them.

As a user, I would like the option of including a link to my professional twitter or linkedin, so that I can connect with other staff members.

As a user, I want staff profiles to have short job descriptions so that I know what someone is responsible for and what they are currently working on.

As web editor, I would like new users to automatically be followers of a specified set of groups, so that they have useful information when they first use the intranet.
To be current, users need to be able to complete and update their own profiles, with some fixed information being automatically pulled from a single source of data to maintain accuracy and consistency, avoiding overlap and ensuring that HR/IT retain control of key data.

### Create staff profile 'edit' view

> As a user I'd like to see a skills listing page so that I can understand who can help me with a particular thing.

(Not on JIRA) As a Web Project Coordinator I want a form to sign up Drupal Accounts to that non trust staff can access Trustnet

PA’s on profiles - 
Editing a profile 

“Add to team (for contractor's)” field - allows them to be added manually to a departmental group but doesn't add them to an org chart or show that they they are part of that team on their profile.
