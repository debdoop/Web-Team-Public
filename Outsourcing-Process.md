Device support and performance standards? Ideally these should be in a publicly accessible GitHub repository. Perhaps a reference to them should be made in the contract. 

FE standards https://github.com/wellcometrust/developer-docs/blob/master/front-end/coding-standards.md

BE standards and team conventions

Contractor site on stage server should have a certificate 


Test code shouldn’t go on stage 

One off exercise by the WT development team per time it is required for a site. 1 weeks notice needed. 

DW to put in JIRA - ticket for the setting up.  (AD-134)

Create a generic contractor GitHub team
Create a generic contractor branch on origin from master (Need to be sure this can work if multiple contractors will be working on the same site. Idea is to minimise the administration of development site setup.)
Add branch to the contractor, CE and Web teams (Need to confirm how permissions are managed e.g. merging to other branches should not be possible by the contractor)
Raise a ticket with CE to create a development site to be built by a Jenkins job polling the contractor branch. Create a .htaccess file with a generic user name.
 with a certificate 



Before a Job

PO makes a proposal 
For each new site CE need 1 weeks notice 
WPC makes acceptance criteria

Request a proposal including

What will be custom code
see if they want to work with a live copy of content 
clarify whether the work impacts UX / FE/ BE of the site 
Get developer github details


Supplier makes proposal 
WPC Passes to UX, FE, BE team leaders for sanity check. Proposal reviewed by whichever team or teams are impacted and accepted or declined before the proposal is accepted and the any work takes place.
WPC arranges for copy of the content if required 


 Per job process

Job is logged in Jira – WPC
To log time against 
So the issue can be passed from contractor to Code Review, to stage testing, to prod and merge and that everyone involved can see the status. 
So that CE tickets can be raised in reference to it
